# Splats Surface Reconstruction - Demo

We provide some sample calls to all the executables provided by this project.

For the moment, the demo only runs with a very simple dataset, and does not show the usage of the full set of parameters available in each call. For a complete list of parameters of each method, please call any of the tools with the `--help` flag.

To run the demo, simply call the following script from this same folder:

```
./run_demo_sphere.sh
```
